- well-known_symbols_Symbol.toPrimitive.js
    - Review coverage for Symbol.toPrimitive calls in many expressions. e.g. addition, subtractiong, comparison, etc
- WeakSet_iterator_closing.js
    - Based in the tests at `built-ins/WeakSet/iterator-*`, add cases for verifying the correct get and call order for the iterator next/return/throw, etc
    - the same is valid for WeakMap, Set, and Map
- Unicode_code_point_escapes_in_identifiers.js / Unicode_code_point_escapes_in_strings.js
    - Needs coverage for cases using unicode code point escapes in:
        - `language/identifiers`
        - `language/reserved-words`
        - `language/literals`
        - `language/keywords`
        - `language/directive-prologue`
        - `language/white-space`
        - arguments object?
        - etc
- Symbol_JSON.stringify_ignores_symbols.js
    - Cover Symbol values in JSON.stringify (`built-ins/JSON/stringify`)
- Set_-0_key_converts_to_+0.js
    - `built-ins/Set/will-not-add-duplicate-entry-normalizes-zero.js`: reconsider verifying -0 normalization fetching the values from the Set.
    - Similar to Map index? Needs to verify
- rest_parameters_new_Function_support.js
    - Add coverage composing fns through `new Function` using rest operators in strings
    - expand to other function constructors
- rest_parameters_cant_be_used_in_setters.js
    - Couldn't find coverage for rest parameters disallowed in setters, needs double check
- Proxy_JSON.stringify_support.js
    - Is it worth adding JSON.stringify behavior over Proxied objects?
- Proxy_internal_set_calls_Array.prototype.push.js / Proxy_internal_set_calls_*.js / Proxy_internal_get_calls_*.js
    - It is interesting to verify Array/String/RegExp/etc methods calling internals being observed with exotic proxy objects.
    - This is a coverage for each method, not Proxy.
    - Rather than add these operations to each method, but most of the Array methods have malstructured legacy tests.
    - It's recommended to review the coverage and recreate tests, adding cases where calls to internals are observed like in this example.
- prototype_of_bound_functions_arrow_functions.js
    - Add coverage for bound special functions
    - Add coverage for checking the prototypes...
    - Add coverage for bound class methods (include static and private)
- Object_static_methods_accept_primitives_Object.freeze.js
    - Needs Coverage Object static methods - e.g. `Object.freeze` - receiving non object values
