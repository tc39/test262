# Community Responsibilities

While [maintainers have many responsibilities](./MAINTAINERS.md), other community members also have a role to play in keeping everything running smoothly.

## Proposal Champions

If not writing tests for their proposals, champions are expected to review PRs for related tests. As experts in the functionality covered, champions have specialized knowledge that helps assure the behavior being tested is correct. Writing tests can also uncover unexpected elisions or contradictions in specification text, which the champions will need to clarify.

## Test Writers

TK — Something about being expected to review documentation and other tests, to write specs in keeping with the values (link when it exists) of the project.

## Implementers

TK — Open issues with detailed bug reports when holes are noticed? Add a report template?

## Everyone

And of course all members are expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and treat everyone involved in the project with kindness and respect.
