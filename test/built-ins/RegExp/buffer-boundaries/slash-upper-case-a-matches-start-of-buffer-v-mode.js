  `\A` matches start of buffer in v-mode.
info: |
  Runtime Semantics: CompileAssertion
  
  Assertion :: \A
    1. Return a new Matcher with parameters (matchState, continue) that captures nothing and performs the following steps when called:
      a. Assert: matchState is a MatchState.
      b. Assert: continue is a MatcherContinuation.
      c. Let e be matchState.[[EndIndex]].
      d. If e = 0, return continue(matchState).
      e. Return ~failure~.
