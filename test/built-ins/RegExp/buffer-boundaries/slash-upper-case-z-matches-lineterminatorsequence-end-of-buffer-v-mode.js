  `\Z` (upper-case z) matches end of buffer after optional LineTerminatorSequence in v-mode.
info: |
  Runtime Semantics: CompileAssertion
  
  Assertion :: \Z
    1. Return a new Matcher with parameters (matchState, continue) that captures nothing and performs the following steps when called:
      a. Assert: matchState is a MatchState.
      b. Assert: continue is a MatcherContinuation.
      c. Let input be matchState.[[Input]].
      d. Let e be matchState.[[EndIndex]].
      e. Let inputLength be the number of elements in input.
      f. If e = inputLength, return continue(matchState).
      g. If e = inputLength - 1 and the character input[e] is matched by |LineTerminator|, then
          i. Return continue(matchState).
      h. If e = inputLength - 2, the character input[e] is matched by <CR>; and the character input[e + 1] is matched by <LF>;, then
          i. Return continue(matchState).
      i. Return failure.
