  The System Object

  The System object is the %System% intrinsic object and the initial value of
  the System property of the global object. The System object is an ordinary
  object.

  The System object is not a function object. It does not have a [[Construct]]
  internal method; it is not possible to use the System object as a constructor
  with the new operator. The System object also does not have a [[Call]]
  internal method; it is not possible to invoke the System object as a
  function.
