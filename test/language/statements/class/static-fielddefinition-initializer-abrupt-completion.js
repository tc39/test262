  33. Let result be InitializeStaticFields(F).
  34. If result is an abrupt completion, then
    a. Set the running execution context's LexicalEnvironment to lex.
    b. Return Completion(result).

  InitializeStaticFields(F)
    1. Assert: Type(F) is Object.
    2. Assert: F is an ECMAScript function object.
    3. Let fieldRecords be the value of F's [[Fields]] internal slot.
    4. For each item fieldRecord in order from fieldRecords,
      a. If fieldRecord.[[static]] is true, then
        i. Perform ? DefineField(F, fieldRecord).

  DefineField(receiver, fieldRecord)
    1. Assert: Type(receiver) is Object.
    2. Assert: fieldRecord is a Record as created by ClassFieldDefinitionEvaluation.
    3. Let fieldName be fieldRecord.[[Name]].
    4. Let initializer be fieldRecord.[[Initializer]].
    5. If initializer is not empty, then
        a. Let initValue be ? Call(initializer, receiver).
