description: Test remapping behaviour of regnal eras
info: |
  CalendarYearMonthFromFields:
  1. Perform ? CalendarResolveFields(_calendar_, _fields_, ~year-month~).
  2. Let _firstDayIndex_ be the 1-based index of the first day of the month
     described by _fields_ (i.e., 1 unless the month's first day is skipped by
     this calendar.)
  3. Set _fields_.[[Day]] to _firstDayIndex_.
  4. Let result be ? CalendarDateToISO(_calendar_, _fields_, _overflow_).

  CalendarResolveFields:
  When the fields of _fields_ are inconsistent with respect to a non-unset
  _fields_.[[Era]], it is recommended that _fields_.[[Era]] and
  _fields_.[[EraYear]] be updated to resolve the inconsistency by lenient
  interpretation of out-of-bounds values (rather than throwing a *RangeError*),
  which is particularly useful for consistent interpretation of dates in
  calendars with regnal eras.
