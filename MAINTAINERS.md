# Test262 Maintainers Group

Being part of the Test262 Maintainers Group comes with great power (merging things!) and the associated great responsibility (merging things!). Below is a list of the general responsibilities of Test262 maintainers and roughly how often the tasks are taken care of. Please remember, most maintainers do this in their free time or as one of many work tasks, and may therefore not respond as quickly as you hope.

## Responsibilities
- **Reviewing PRs** (1-2x/week)
- **Reviewing test plans and helping guide contributors before PRs are submitted** (1-2x/week, as needed)
- **Reviewing Stage 3 proposals and prioritizing related tests** (6x/yr, following TC39 plenaries)
- **Fielding requests and suggestions for improvement from users(contributors, implementers, etc. TKTK link here to priority of constituencies TKTK)** (ongoing, as needed)
- **Maintaining and evolving our list of values, tutorials, and other documentation** (ongoing, as needed)

## How We Make Decisions
Everyday decisions, such as reviews and prioritization can be made by single maintainers in accordance with the values (TK LINK TO VALUES LIST TK) and rationales (TK LINK TO RATIONALES TK) laid out in this repo.

Larger or more controversial decisions will be made by a consensus minus one process, which is to say if all members but one are in favor of a decision, the proposal carries. These discussions may take place in real-time meetings or asynchronously in the repository as preferred by the maintainers.

Requests for changes can be submitted through the RFC process. TK TK LINK IF WE AGREE TK TK

## How Do I Become a Member of the Maintainers Group?

New members can be added to the group of maintainers by creating a PR against the list of maintainers [LINK TK], and outlining contributions made to the project. There is no strict list of contribution types to be met. Rather contributions can include: writing tests, reviewing PRs, and helping maintain the project, including triaging needed coverage after plenary. Anyone interested in joining the group is also encouraged to attend maintainers meetings, as listed on the TC39 calendar.

The decision will be made according to the consensus minus one model.

Community members who are interested in training specifically to become a project maintainer are encouraged to reach out to the maintainers group for a three-month training.

## How Are Maintainers Removed from the Maintainers Group?

Maintainers can be removed from the maintainers group for two general reasons: contravening the Code of Conduct or otherwise problematic behavior; or no longer fulfilling the group responsibilities. Those in the first group can be removed at any time by the rest of the group through a consensus-minus-one decision.

Those in the second group will be contacted four to six months after their last contribution and asked if they intend to continue on. If not, they will be removed from the maintainers group for decision-making purposes
