    GetBindingValue (N, S)

    [...]
    3. If the binding for N is an indirect binding, then
       a. Let M and N2 be the indirection values provided when this binding for
          N was created.
       b. Let targetEnv be M.[[Environment]].
       c. If targetEnv is undefined, throw a ReferenceError exception.
       d. Let targetER be targetEnv's EnvironmentRecord.
       e. Return ? targetER.GetBindingValue(N2, S).
