# ECMAScript Language test262 

## What is test262?

test262 is a test suite intended to check agreement between JavaScript
implementations and ECMA-262, the ECMAScript Language Specification
(currently 5.1 Edition). The test suite contains thousands of individual tests,
each of which tests some specific requirements of the ECMAScript Language Specification.


## What is ECMAScript?

"ECMAScript" is the name under which the language more commonly known as "JavaScript"
is standardized.
Development of the ECMAScript standard is the responsibility of
[Technical Committee 39 (TC39)](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm) of
[Ecma International](http://www.ecma-international.org/). The ECMAScript Language
Specification standard is officially known as ECMA-262. ECMAScript 5.1 (or just ES5.1) is
short hand for the "ECMA-262, 5.1 Edition ECMAScript Language Specification" the official name
of the current edition of the standard. ECMAScript 5.1 was approved as an official
Ecma standard by the Ecma General Assembly in June 2011.
The ECMAScript 5.1 standard is available in
[PDF](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf)
and [HTML](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) versions from the Ecma International web site.


## Who creates and maintains test262?

Development of test262 is a project of Ecma TC39. The testing framework and
individual tests are created by member organizations of TC39 and contributed
to Ecma for use in test262. For more information about how test262 is developed
and maintained visit [the oficial webpage](http://test262.ecmascript.org/) (under the "Development"-Tab).


## What is the status of test262?
**test262 is not yet complete. It is still undergoing active development.**
Some portions of the ES5 specification have very complete test coverage while
other portions of the specification have only partial test coverage.
Some tests may be invalid or may yield false positive or false negative results.
A perfect passing score on test262 does not guarantee that a JavaScript implementation
perfectly supports ES5. Because tests are being actively added and modified,
tests results from different days or times may not be directly comparable.
